When you get slightly bored of sunbathing and your supercool tan starts looking like burnt skins, you can always turn to some great adventures for an extraordinary experience. There are a couple of underwater activities that also allow you to interact with the enigmatic marine life."

With their pristine waters and vibrant parties, these islands are a wonderful way to spend a few days in Thailand. With four other islands besides the large ones, Phi Phi houses Bida Nok, Bida Nai, Ko Mai Phai, is also known as Bamboo Island. Phi Phi Islands became famous after the 2000 Hollywood flick 'The Beach' that was shot in Ko Phi Phi Le. Ko Phi Phi Leh houses The Viking Cave which is a thriving industry that sells edible birds nests.It's striking cliffs, white sand beaches with jungles all around and clear blue waters make it look nothing short of paradise. None of the islands has roads, and most of the islands are humanly inhabited, making Phi Phi Islands one of the few untainted beautiful landscapes left in the world. These easily accessible islands can be reached from both Phuket and Krabi, by a speedboat in just 45 minutes or by a ferry in 90 minutes."

It is world-renowned for its scenic rice terraces, fragrant cuisine,stunning beaches and a galore of culture and tradition. With its elaborate temples, endless coastline, some of the world's best coral reefs, waterfalls and retreats, Bali combines leisure and adventure impeccably. A dizzying combination of spiritual awakening and hard-partying all into one,  Bali is where people from all over the world come to lose themselves in.The island boasts some of the best sunsets and sunrises, enough to captivate and entice you into never leaving this place. Home to the coral reefs of Tulamben, the mountain peaks of Kintamani, the beaches and scenic routes of Seminyak and Kuta, with ancient temples and traditional village life of Ubud, Bali's charm is boundless, as are its opportunities for fun. Don’t forget to stop by one of the many terraced rice fields, a feature that only adds to the diversity of Bali’s beautiful landscape. Tourists may enjoy an idyllic day at the beach, surf, dive, take a casual boat ride to gaze at the dolphins, explore the many beautiful temples, the local markets and the waterfalls, or go to the silent yoga retreats - there is something for everybody here. Bali has been the subject of so many travel journals and has been famously alluded to in many works of literature, as a place of true beauty, and yet words always fail to capture the captivating magic of 'The Island of the Gods"

They form as a result of the rare rain that reaches the usually dry desert land.Some flora and fauna linger around this area, having adapted to the rough conditions, but it’s when moisture seeps its way into the environment that it truly flourishes. A lake forms in Sossusvlei, coaxing thousands of birds to the location in an impressive spectacle."
